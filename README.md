## Introduction

thermondo is committed to ensuring the security of the public by protecting their information. This
policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability
discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to
us.

This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send
us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly
disclosing vulnerabilities.

We encourage you to contact us to report potential vulnerabilities in our systems.

## Authorization

If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will
consider your research to be authorized, we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
quickly, and thermondo will not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research. Should
legal action be initiated by a third party against you for activities that were conducted in
accordance with this policy, we will make this authorization known.

## Guidelines

Under this policy, "research" means activities in which you:

* Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to
  production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
* Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability's presence. Do not use an
  exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish persistent command line access, or use the
  exploit to pivot to other systems.
* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
* Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

Once you've established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data
(including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information
or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose
this data to anyone else.

## Test methods

The following test methods are not authorized:

* Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests or other tests that impair access to or damage a
  system or data
* Physical testing (e.g. office access, open doors, tailgating), social engineering (e.g. phishing,
  vishing), or any other non-technical vulnerability testing

## Scope

This policy applies to the systems and services found at:

* `*.thermondo.de`

Any service not expressly listed above, such as any connected services, are excluded from scope and
are not authorized for testing. Additionally, vulnerabilities found in systems from our vendors
fall outside of this policy's scope and should be reported directly to the vendor according to
their disclosure policy (if any). If you aren't sure whether a system is in scope or not, contact
us using the contact information in our [security.txt file][security_txt] before starting your
research.

Though we develop and maintain other internet-accessible systems or services, we ask that active
research and testing only be conducted on the systems and services covered by the scope of this
document. If there is a particular system not in scope that you think merits testing, please
contact us to discuss it first. We will increase the scope of this policy over time.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Information submitted under this policy will be used for defensive purposes only — to mitigate or
remediate vulnerabilities. If your findings include newly discovered vulnerabilities that affect
all users of a product or service and not solely thermondo, we may share your report with the
owners of that product or service. We will not share your name or contact information without
express permission.

We accept vulnerability reports using the contact information in our [security.txt file][security_txt].
Reports may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will acknowledge receipt
of your report within 3 business days.

## Bounties

We award bounties for vulnerability disclosures based on severity. Disclosures that are low-quality,
low-impact, or otherwise in violation of this policy will not receive bounty payments. By submitting
a vulnerability, you acknowledge that you have no expectation of payment.

### Exclusions

The following are considered out-of-scope and will not be rewarded with a bounty:

* Reports that state that software is out of date or vulnerable without a proof of concept.
* Highly speculative reports about theoretical damage. Be specific.
* Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they’re an
  issue.
* Issues in third-party services (those should be reported to the respective service).

## What we would like to see from you

In order to help us triage and prioritize submissions, we recommend that your reports:

* Describe the location the vulnerability was discovered and the potential impact of exploitation.
* Offer a detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept
  scripts or screenshots are helpful).
* Be in English or German, if possible.

## What you can expect from us

When you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to coordinating with you as
openly and as quickly as possible.

* Within 3 business days, we will acknowledge that your report has been received.
* To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to you and be as
  transparent as possible about what steps we are taking during the remediation process, including
  on issues or challenges that may delay resolution.
* We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.

## Questions

Questions regarding this policy may be sent to the contact in our [security.txt file][security_txt].
We also invite you to contact us with suggestions for improving this policy.
